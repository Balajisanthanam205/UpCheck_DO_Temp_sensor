**ESP32 IoT Sensor Monitoring System using Supabase**

**Project Overview**

This project is an IoT-based real-time monitoring system that reads Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) values using an ESP32 microcontroller and transmits the data to Supabase.
A web-based dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript retrieves and displays the sensor data in real time.

**The system is designed to demonstrate end-to-end IoT integration, covering:**

Sensor data acquisition
Cloud data storage
Web-based visualization

**Features**

Real-time sensor data acquisition using ESP32
Temperature monitoring (DS18B20 / equivalent)
Dissolved Oxygen (DO) sensor integration
Cloud backend using Supabase
Web dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Automatic data updates without page reload
Responsive UI (works on desktop and mobile)
